# Differences from `node-irc`
The `node-irc` library isn't well maintained and there are a number of issues which are impacting development of the [Matrix-IRC application service](http://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc). We made the decision to fork the project in order to improve reliability of the application service. A summary of modifications from `node-irc@0.3.12` are below:
 - https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc/pull/386 - Manifested as [BOTS-80](https://matrix.org/jira/browse/BOTS-80)
